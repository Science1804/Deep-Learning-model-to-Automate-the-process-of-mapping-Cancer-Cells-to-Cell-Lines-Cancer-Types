# Deep-Learning-model-to-Automate-the-process-of-mapping-Cancer-Cells-to-Cell-Lines-Cancer-Types.

Please refere the paper for understanding the methodology - https://ijsrcseit.com/paper/CSEIT21741.pdf 
To retrain your own model or recreate my work - please open the folder - Training the model, and the run the files in sequence in jupyter notbook. 
Note that 02 will require you to install an R kernel on your jupyter notebook - do that using the link : https://datatofish.com/r-jupyter-notebook/ 
Rest of the steps are guided in the notebook . 

To run my trained model open the file " Use the model to Predict... .ipynb" 
There is an example dataset given here which will be displayed in the dataframe when ran throught the code.
